= ChartPress Wizard Frontend

The ChartPress Wizard frontend is a React-based web application designed to simplify the process of generating Helm charts for Kubernetes deployments. It provides a user-friendly interface for configuring umbrella charts and subcharts.

== Features

- Interactive UI for configuring umbrella charts and subcharts.
- Generates configuration files for Helm charts.
- Integrates seamlessly with the backend API to process and generate charts.

== Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or later).
- npm (Node Package Manager).

== Installation

1. Navigate to the `web` directory:
   ```
   cd ./web
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

== Usage

1. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

3. Use the interface to configure your umbrella chart and subcharts.

4. Submit the configuration to generate the Helm chart files.

== Building for Production

To build the application for production:

1. Run the build command:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

2. The production-ready files will be available in the `build` directory.

== Docker Deployment

The application can be deployed using Docker:

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```
   docker build -t chartpress-frontend .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:
   ```
   docker run -p 80:80 chartpress-frontend
   ```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost`.

== Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with OpenSSL, ensure you are using the `--openssl-legacy-provider` flag as configured in the `package.json` scripts.
- Ensure all dependencies are installed by running `npm install`.

Suggested Features for the Web App Dynamic Form for Chart Configuration

Allow users to dynamically add or remove subcharts.::
Provide dropdowns for selecting workloads (e.g., Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet).

Real-Time Validation::
Validate user inputs (e.g., chart names, workload types) in real-time. Display error messages for invalid configurations.

Preview Configuration::
Show a preview of the generated chartpress.yaml file before submission.

Download Generated Charts::
Provide a button to download the generated Helm chart files as a ZIP archive.

Integration with Backend API::
Submit configurations to the backend /generate endpoint. Display success or error messages based on the API response.

Theming Support::
Add light and dark mode options for better user experience.

Multi-Language Support::
Allow users to switch between different languages for the UI.

Help and Documentation Section::
Include a help section with instructions on how to use the app.
Link to external documentation for advanced usage.

Persistent State::
Save user inputs locally (e.g., using localStorage) so they are not lost on page refresh.

Responsive Design::
Ensure the app works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

Progress Indicator::
Show a loading spinner or progress bar while the backend processes the request.

Error Reporting::
Provide detailed error messages if the backend fails to generate charts.

Version Information::
Display the current version of the app and backend API.

Custom Templates::
Allow users to upload custom templates for umbrella charts or subcharts.

Analytics Dashboard::
Provide insights into the most commonly used configurations or workloads.
