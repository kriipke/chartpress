ðŸ§© Chartpress Microservice Ontology

1. API Gateway
	â€¢	Label: api-gateway
	â€¢	Workload: Deployment
	â€¢	Description: Serves as the single entry point for clients, routing requests to appropriate backend services, handling concerns like authentication, rate limiting, and response aggregation.  ï¿¼

2. Backend for Frontend (BFF)
	â€¢	Label: bff
	â€¢	Workload: Deployment
	â€¢	Description: Tailors APIs to specific client needs, such as web or mobile applications, by aggregating data from multiple services.  ï¿¼

3. Web Server
	â€¢	Label: web-server
	â€¢	Workload: Deployment
	â€¢	Description: Hosts static content and serves as the frontend interface, often implemented using frameworks like React or Angular.

4. API Service
	â€¢	Label: api-service
	â€¢	Workload: Deployment
	â€¢	Description: Handles business logic and exposes RESTful or GraphQL APIs to clients.

5. Worker Service
	â€¢	Label: worker
	â€¢	Workload: Deployment
	â€¢	Description: Processes asynchronous tasks, such as background jobs or message consumption, often communicating via message queues.

6. Message Queue
	â€¢	Label: message-queue
	â€¢	Workload: StatefulSet
	â€¢	Description: Facilitates asynchronous communication between services, commonly implemented using systems like RabbitMQ or Kafka.

7. Database
	â€¢	Label: database
	â€¢	Workload: StatefulSet
	â€¢	Description: Stores persistent data, with each microservice typically having its own database to ensure loose coupling. ï¿¼

8. Cache
	â€¢	Label: cache
	â€¢	Workload: StatefulSet
	â€¢	Description: Provides fast, in-memory data storage to improve application performance, often using systems like Redis.

9. Configuration Server
	â€¢	Label: config-server
	â€¢	Workload: Deployment
	â€¢	Description: Manages externalized configuration for services, allowing dynamic updates without redeployment.

10. Service Registry
	â€¢	Label: service-registry
	â€¢	Workload: Deployment
	â€¢	Description: Maintains a directory of service instances, enabling dynamic discovery and load balancing.

11. Circuit Breaker
	â€¢	Label: circuit-breaker
	â€¢	Workload: Deployment
	â€¢	Description: Monitors service interactions and prevents cascading failures by halting requests to failing services.

12. Monitoring
	â€¢	Label: monitoring
	â€¢	Workload: Deployment
	â€¢	Description: Collects and visualizes metrics, logs, and traces to observe system health and performance.

13. Logging
	â€¢	Label: logging
	â€¢	Workload: Deployment
	â€¢	Description: Aggregates and stores logs from various services for analysis and debugging.

14. Authentication Service
	â€¢	Label: auth-service
	â€¢	Workload: Deployment
	â€¢	Description: Manages user authentication and authorization, issuing tokens and handling access control.

15. Scheduler
	â€¢	Label: scheduler
	â€¢	Workload: CronJob
	â€¢	Description: Executes scheduled tasks, such as periodic data processing or maintenance jobs.
